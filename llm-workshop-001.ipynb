       "'The error \"invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase\" can often occur when mapping volumes with Docker on Windows because the filesystem paths sometimes include uppercase letters. Here\\'s a detailed solution:\\n\\n1. **Move Data to a Folder Without Spaces**: Ensure that your data is not in a directory with spaces in its name. For example:\\n   - **Correct**: `C:/git/...`\\n   - **Incorrect**: `C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/...`\\n\\n2. **Use Lowercase Paths**: Ensure that your paths and repository names are entirely in lowercase.\\n\\n3. **Volume Mapping Options**:\\n   - **Option 1**:\\n     ```shell\\n     -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n     ```\\n   - **Option 2**:\\n     ```shell\\n     -v //c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n     ```\\n   - **Option 3**:\\n     ```shell\\n     -v /c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n     ```\\n   - **Option 4**:\\n     ```shell\\n     -v //c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n     ```\\n   - **Option 5**:\\n     ```shell\\n     --volume //c/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Adding `winpty` Before the Command**:\\n   ```shell\\n   winpty docker run -it \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" \\\\\\n   -e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" \\\\\\n   -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\\\\n   -p 5432:5432 \\\\\\n   postgres:1\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Using Quotes**:\\n   ```shell\\n   -v \"/c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   -v \"//c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   -v \"/c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   -v \"//c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   ```\\n\\n6. **Using `$(pwd)`**:\\n   ```shell\\n   -v \"$(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\\n   ```\\n\\n7. **Using a Volume Name Instead of the Path**:\\n   ```shell\\n   -v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\\n   ```\\n\\nEnsure the paths adhere strictly to the formats stated above and that all parts, especially the repository names, are in lowercase.
